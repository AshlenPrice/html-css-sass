      <p>Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when such behaviour
      was still a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with DES
      (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16
      days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest
      determined his death as suicide, but it has been noted that the known
      evidence is equally consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009,
      following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made
      an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the
      appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous
      pardon in 2013.</p>
